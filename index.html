            <p>Top climate scientists issued a “code red for humanity” recently, warning that this is our last chance to implement the transformational changes necessary to keep warming below 1.5 C and avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate chaos.<br><br>

              Philippine’s climate targets are still critically insufficient to do our fair share on the global scale and we are one of the N11 countries whose emissions have increased since the Paris Agreement was signed.<br><br>
              
              The climate crisis won’t wait. Join us in calling on all federal parties or the people (mamamayan) to cooperate and get Philippines to act on climate change with the ambition and urgency this crisis demands!</p>

            <p>“We use too much, too much of it is toxic and we don’t share it very well. But that’s not the way things have to be. Together, we can build a society based on better not more, sharing not selfishness, community not division.” — The Story of Stuff<br><br>

              Focusing on life’s simple pleasures — spending time in nature, being with loved ones, making a difference to others — provides more purpose, belonging and happiness than buying and consuming. Plus, when we consume less, we produce fewer emissions and are gentler on the earth. Sharing, making, fixing, upcycling, repurposing and composting are all good places to start.<br><br>
              
              Fire up your commitment to the people and places you love by acting every day on the understanding that we are one with nature.</p>

              Domesticated animals, such as livestock, provide us food, fiber and leather. Wild animals, including birds, fish, insects and pollinators, are important to support the web of activity in a functioning ecosystem.<br><br>

              The many ways to reduce your transportation emissions will also make you healthier, happier and save you a few bucks. Whenever and wherever you can:<br><br>
              
              • Take public transit<br>
              • Ride a bike or advocate for bike lanes in your community<br>

              • If you have a large, inefficient vehicle, retire it and switch to an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle<br>
              • Fly less (if you do fly, make sure you offset your emissions)><hc2></p>

        <h2>Junior Highschool Student</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Villacorta, Andrei I.<br><br>

          Welcome to my presentation, specifically my assignment for English, and I'd want to share about myself. I really loved coding as a kid, because as far as I can remember, when I was 9, I saw a video showing about coding, hacking and stuff, I was really amazed and decided to check it out.<br><br>
          
          My first programming language was Lua via. ROBLOX and it is where I started to learn much more about coding, and I was at age of 10 at this time. So on 2 years had past by and I've memorized, mastered, honed all the basic, some of the advanced sections of scripting.<br><br>
          
          I decided to explore more programming languages like, Javascript, Python, and then as of now, CSS is my main priority in coding.
